# UFOs
## OVERVIEW:

Building a dynamic webpage to display information on UFO sightings throughout the world. Starting by creating/importing JavaScript code into a HTML page and formatting it with CSS.

## RESULTS:

A small set of sightings will already be displayed when opening the page, however, the filter area(FIG below) gives you a multitude of criteria to help narrow your search for particular sightings

## DRAWBACKS:

The main issue this webpage has is that the information isn't connected to a live feed that gets updated, recent sightings will not be added unless manually entered or pulled from a up-to-date database.

Issues arise when you don't search by exact names and dates, the filters as well as the data are case-sensitive, ex. 'boulder' will sort sightings exclusive to Boulder, CO. 'BOULDER' will result in an empty table.


## QUALITY OF LIFE IDEAS:

The addition of button-click interactions and maybe a column filter to sort by the duration of sightings(ascending/descending) to enhance the user experience

Like I mentioned above, the integration of a live feed to keep up to date with the latest sighting would be interesting, it would promote traffic back to the page in the future.
